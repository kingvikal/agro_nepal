# final_year_project

As part of my academic coursework, I developed an eCommerce application using Flutter, a mobile application development framework. The application is designed to provide an intuitive and responsive user interface for customers to browse and purchase agricultural products from an online store.

Features of the application include:

    1. Authentication
    2. Product catalog browsing
    3. Product search functionality
    4. Shopping cart management
    5. Payment gateway integration (Khalti)
    6. Order history

In building this project, I gained hands-on experience in working with Flutter widgets and state management, as well as integrating external APIs and libraries for authentication and payment processing. I also collaborated with a colleague to implement agile development methodologies, version control using Git.

This project showcases my proficiency in mobile application development using Flutter and my ability to work in a team to deliver high-quality software solutions.
